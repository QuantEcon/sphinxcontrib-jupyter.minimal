# sphinxcontrib-jupyter.minimal

A Minimal Example of the Jupyter Sphinx Extension

This is a minimal example of a Sphinx project that is setup
to use the [Jupyter Extension](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter>)

This requires you to install the extension:

    pip install sphinxcontrib-jupyter

> **Note:** This example currently only works using the latest [master](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter)
> and installing using `python setup.py install`. Awaiting for PyPI credentials to update releases. 

Once cloned you should be able to run:

    make jupyter

to generate a small set of demo jupyter notebooks.

Generated notebooks can be found in the `_build/jupyter/` folder.
